# OpenAPI generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

To install the anomaly detection module clone this project : https://github.com/DApIA-Project/Anomaly-Detection.git. \
Follow the 'lib compilation' instructions in the README. You have to build the file `AircraftClassifier-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl` with 
```
python build.py sdist bdist_wheel
```
Move `AircraftClassifier-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl` in `/openapi_server/controllers/` of this project.

And do this when you are not using docker
```
pip install dist/AircraftClassifier-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
``` 
in `/openapi_server/controllers/`

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m openapi_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:3002/ui/
```

Your OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:3002/openapi.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t openapi_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 3002:3002 openapi_server
```
